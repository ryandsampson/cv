      <p>I am the Lead and only Estimator for Stansell Electric in East Tennessee. My work focuses on trasportation
        projects, such as traffic signals and airports, and heavy infrastructure, such as utility duct banks, overhead and
        underground electric utility work, and overhead and underground communication utility work. I also perform commercial
